# Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password of a specified length.

## How it works

The script uses Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules to generate a password. The password can include uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

## Functions

- `generate_password(length)`: This function generates a random password. The `length` parameter specifies the length of the password. The function returns the generated password as a string.

- `main()`: This function prompts the user for the desired password length, checks if the input is a valid positive integer, and then calls `generate_password(length)` to generate a password. If the input is invalid or non-positive, it prints an error message.

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment. When prompted, enter the desired length of the password. The script will then print the generated password.

Please note that this script does not include any mechanisms for securely storing, transmitting, or displaying the generated password. It's intended for educational purposes and not for generating passwords in a production environment. Always follow best practices for password management in a real-world setting. 

## Requirements

- Python 3
- No additional packages are required.
